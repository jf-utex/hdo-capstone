# Human Dimensions of Organizations Capstone Project

Here you will find my website designed to stand for my Capstone project to recieve my Masters of Arts Degree from the University of Texas - Austin.

This project outlines the research that was done over the 18 month program and focuses on the field of Orthotics and Prosthetics. While working through this program, it became clear to me that organizational culture has an impact on employee engagement, organizational wellbeing and ultimatly, organizational sustainabiltiy.

The website itself is built on React for the front end, uses MongoDB hosted on mLab for user authentication and commenting ability and Google OAuth for user authentication.  The site is hosted on Heroku. 

The long term expectations of this project is to serve as a call to action thr the O&P community to look into the organizational culture while reflecting on what other allied health organizations have expereinced through this awarness.

Thank you for interacting.
