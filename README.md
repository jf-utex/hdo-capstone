# Human Dimensions of Organizations Capstone Project

Here, you will find my website designed to stand for my final Capstone project toward my Masters of Arts Degree from the University of Texas - Austin.

This project outlines the research that was done over the 18 month program and focuses on the field of Orthotics and Prosthetics. While working through this program, it became clear to me that organizational culture has an impact on employee engagement, organizational wellbeing and ultimately, organizational sustainability.

The website itself is built on React for the front end, uses MongoDB hosted on mLab for user authentication and commenting ability. Finally, Google OAuth is used for user authentication.  The site is hosted on Heroku.

The long term expectations of this project is to serve as a call to action to the O&P community to look into the organizational culture while reflecting on what other allied health organizations have experienced through this awareness.

Currently it is a work in progress with more data to be entered between now and our graduation date of December 8, 2017.

Thank you for interacting.
