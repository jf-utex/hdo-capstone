                In order to be an effective leader, one must be able to
                motivate. The leader must understand a person whether it be the
                influences of their generational cohort, personal history or
                previous experience at work. Having this information can help
                foster connections between employees and develop an environment
                that will encourage not only the organizational growth through
                mission and vision but also the growth of the individual
                employee.

                As previously mentioned, an issue that faces the O&P profession
                is that there is no current leadership training in our
                curriculum or in practice. There is no peer reviewed research
                into transformational leadership within O&P. This may be an
                increasing concern as we compete for pay sources, attempt to
                maintain a level of professionalism equal to that of other
                allied health care groups and may be impacting our recruitment
                and retention. I believe it is our responsibility to explore our
                culture and behavior through a critical lens to better serve
                ourselves and our public.

                Turning again to the “Practice Analysis of Certified
                Practitioners in the Disciplines of Orthotics and Prosthetics”
                we see that most practitioners have been in the field for more
                than 11 years with a stark decrease in the number of clinicians
                serving 10 years or less. I’m not sure what this indicates but
                would lead me to wonder if there is a lack of interest in the
                field or if individuals are leaving the field. This is a
                question that could be answered with a look into our culture.
                Now that we require a Master’s level of education to enter the
                field, we have the opportunity to expand the definition of
                acceptable research to encourage examination of our
                organization. With the O&P workforce of just over 6,000
                practitioners in 2017, we continue to be a small division of
                medicine. Recruiting and retention should be a focus to sustain,
                even grow the field, as qualified O&P practitioners will be
                needed to care for our aging population.
              </p>
              <p>
                To grow the field and encourage new applicants to our O&P
                schools, two things must happen, we must first understand what
                traits or behaviors seem to be associated with each generation
                in the workforce and how they perceive effective leadership. We
                have looked a little into that here, but there is more to be
                done as Generation Z ages fully into the workforce and
                expectations that come with “stage of life” shift in other
                generations. By keeping pace with our employees, we will be
                closer to easing the transition as one group leaves and the
                other replaces it as well as possibly identifying factors that
                may help with recruiting and retention.

                The labor force is affected by a number of people retiring each
                year with a direct impact on the economy’s capacity to produce
                goods and services (Ahn & Ettner, 2017). We must be careful not
                to stereotype a particular generation instead, we must consider
                that an individual employee’s preferences may be related to
                maturity, life‐cycle and career stage. This will help us to
                avoid developing generationally specific management policies and
                practices (Macky, Gardner, & Forsyth, 2008)

                Second, we must take a critical look at how we have been
                operating and why we are not more diverse with regards to gender
                and ethnicity. We should also look at the level of engagement in
                our current practitioners. Are they looking to transition out of
                the field? Are they fulfilled in their practice? How can
                Leadership and Management facilitate engagement through
                organizational citizenship? As we begin to examine our own
                clinical workforce we must take into account individual
                preferences for leadership behavior and acknowledge that this
                may require a shift in leadership attitude, policy, and
                implementation. (Ahn & Ettner, 2017) The accepted leadership
                behavior in some organizations outside Orthotics and Prosthetics
                is transformational leadership, a style of leadership where a
                leader works with subordinates to identify needed change,
                creating a vision to guide the change through inspiration, and
                executing the change in tandem with committed members of a
                group. (Ahn & Ettner, 2017) This model of leadership would work
                well in this profession that maintains a need for mentorship in
                the clinical practice.

                The field of Nursing specifically has examined the concept of
                circular communication as a next step toward engagement. There
                is an understanding that peer to peer communication as well as
                supervisor to subordinate communication should be circular - a
                two-way dialogue with follow up and acknowledgement of peer to
                peer communication needs. Using tools such as the Maslach's
                Burnout Inventory and the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire
                may provide insight to employee burnout and the leadership style
                perceived to be most effective. (Zopiatis, Krambia-Kapardis, &
                Varnavas, 2012)
              </p>
              <p>
                Within O&P leadership directives, there is no feedback loop in
                peer to peer interactions relating to leadership. We are
                responsible to have circular feedback with our patients however,
                with employees and leaders/management, the same accountability
                is not upheld. There is no closure to suggestions or issues that
                are taken up the chain of command. This lack of accountability
                may be interpreted as a lack of respect and concern for the
                employee issues. Broadly, this affects all generations in the
                workplace.
              </p>

              <p>
                Without communication, the employee feels a lack of respect and
                importance within their organizational role. If repeated over
                time there may come a point of disengagement. When an employee
                disengages, they are not as committed to the patients or the
                organization, their creativity is dampened and creative
                solutions for orthotic and prosthetic problems are reduced. The
                patient in the end, pays for this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nursing is also looking at issues relating to guidance of the
                millennial generation. They are asking how to provide guidance
                to the new generations without alienating the incumbent
                workforce while providing a structure to leadership.
                (Weingarten, 2009)
              </p>
              <p>
                As we may see, the field of nursing deals with similar
                leadership issues as Orthotics and Prosthetics and can be used
                as a first example of some of the questions we should ask in
                future O&P research. Because nursing also deals with shift
                differentials, on call and balancing patient needs with employee
                needs and expectations there are enough similarities to pattern
                future O&P research into organizational culture and behavior and
                how to encourage employee citizenship.

                  “Companies that actively invest in their employees’
                  satisfaction find that individual loyalty to the company is
                  significantly higher. This in turn results in workers’
                  transcending what is asked of them. High employee satisfaction
                  translates to higher productivity without compromising
                  quality, which yields better customer service and increased
                  profits and growth for the company.” (Patel, 2015)
