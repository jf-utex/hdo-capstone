                  The field of orthotics and prosthetics does not provide
                  training in leadership.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No training in multigenerational workforce interactions or
                  acknowledgement of peer to peer communication needs. Any
                  training that is provided is related to patient care.

                  Comparatively, the field of nursing is looking at these issues
                  and has done some research to work through these issues. How
                  can we provide guidance to the new generations without
                  alienating the incumbent workforce while providing a structure
                  to leadership?

                <li>
                  Generational expectations of the workforce have been examined
                  in nursing. Nursing deals with similar leadership issues as
                  Orthotics and Prosthetics. Shift differentials, on call and
                  balancing patient needs with employee needs and expectations.
                  Nursing has more research into how to isolate and ameliorate
                  these issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compare literature from Nursing to that of O&P which has zero
                  peer reviewed literature on this subject.

                  We must be careful of stereotypes and realize these
                  “generational” preferences may have more to do with stage of
                  life than their “generational cohort”
                </li>
                <li>
                  The generation gap has always existed. We need to find a way
                  to close the gap and tap into the strengths of each generation
                  while lending our experience to the next generation for
                  operational excellence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Searching the library databases for “orthotics or prosthetics”
                  AND “mentor*” turns up 39 results, very few are reflections or
                  research about mentoring in the O&P workplace
                </li>
                <li>
                  This demonstrates that very little research has been done in
                  the O&P on its own professional culture. ● Other medical
                  fields, such as nursing, regularly produce research reflecting
                  on their own practices of mentoring, examinations of workplace
                  culture and communication, and gender dynamics.

                  Because of this lack of research, I will use the nursing field
                  as a parallel. They have done research and have a gender
                  imbalance The generation gap has always existed. We need to
                  find a way to close the gap and tap into the strengths of each
                  generation while lending our experience to the next generation
                  for operational excellence. We must be careful not to
                  stereotype generations.

                  There is no feedback loop in peer to peer interactions
                  relating to leadership in many healthcare situations (O&P). We
                  are responsible to have circular feedback with our patients
                  however, with employees and leaders/management, the same
                  accountability is not upheld. There is no closure to
                  suggestions or issues that are taken up the chain of command.
                  This lack of accountability shows a lack of respect and
                  concern for the employee issues and affects all generations in
                  the workplace.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Without communication, the employee feels a lack of respect
                  and importance within their organizational role. If this is
                  repeated over time, at least in my case, there comes a point
                  of disengagement. When an employee disengages, they are not as
                  committed to the patients, their creativity is dampened and
                  therefore creative solutions for orthotic and prosthetic
                  problems are reduced. The patient in the end, pays for this.

                  As stated on the website for Northwestern University - "The
                  research program at Northwestern University
                  Prosthetics-Orthotics Center (NUPOC) was founded in 1956
                  followed by the education program in 1958. The goal of our
                  research is to improve the quality of life for persons who use
                  prostheses (limb replacements) and orthoses (braces/splints)
                  through creative applications of science and engineering to
                  the field of P&O and to disseminate new knowledge in P&O to
                  the public through publications in professional journals,
                  presentations at symposia, webinars and other media. Research
                  strives to improve quantification and objective scientific
                  evidence that informs P&O clinical decision-making; and to
                  develop new concepts and devices that will improve the
                  quality, cost-effectiveness, and delivery of P&O fittings.
                  Research is funded through competitive grants from agencies
                  that have included the Department of Veteran's Affairs, the
                  National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research
                  (NIDRR), the Department of Defense, the Orthotic and
                  Prosthetic Education and Research Foundation (OPERF) and
                  private industry grants." You can see this directly at:{" "}
