                As previously mentioned, an issue that faces the O&P profession
                is that there is no current leadership training in our
                curriculum or in practice. We, as a profession, are not looking
                at our culture through a critical lens to isolate strengths and
                weaknesses. Most of the literature to date reflects concern for
                managing patient centered needs and concerns, patient compliance
                and O&P technology. There is no peer reviewed research into
                transformational leadership within O&P. This may be an
                increasing concern as we compete for pay sources, attempt to
                maintain a level of professionalism equal to that of other
                allied health care groups and may be impacting our recruitment
                and retention. I believe it is our responsibility to explore our
                culture and behavior through a critical lens to better serve
                ourselves and our public.

                Turning again to the “Practice Analysis of Certified
                Practitioners in the Disciplines of Orthotics and Prosthetics”
                we see that most practitioners have been in the field for more
                than 11 years with a stark decrease in the number of clinicians
                serving 10 years or less. I’m not sure what this indicates but
                would lead me to wonder if there is a lack of interest in the
                field or if individuals are leaving the field as I have. This is
                a question that could be answered with a look into our culture.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we move toward requiring a Master’s and PhD level of
                education, it would seem our focus has shifted from encouraging
                new practitioners to join the field, to maintaining and
                educating those that are already established. With the O&P
                workforce of just over 6,000 practitioners in 2017, we continue
                to be a small division of medicine. Recruitment and retention
                should be a focus to sustain, even grow the field, as qualified
                O&P practitioners will be needed to care for our aging
                population.
              </p>
              <p>
                To grow the field and encourage new applicants to our O&P
                schools, two things must happen, we must first understand what
                traits or behaviors seem to be associated with each generation
                in the workforce, and how they perceive effective leadership. We
                have looked a little into that here, but there is more to be
                done. By examining these expectations, we will be closer to
                easing the transition as one group leaves and the other replaces
                it as well as potentially identifying factors that may help with
                recruitment and retention. The labor force is affected by a
                number of people retiring each year with a direct impact on the
                economy’s capacity to produce goods and services (Ahn & Ettner,
                2017). We must be careful not to stereotype a particular
                generation instead, we must consider that an individual
                employee’s preferences may be related to maturity, life‐cycle
                and career stage. This will help us to avoid developing
                generationally specific management policies and practices
                (Macky, Gardner, & Forsyth, 2008)
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, we must take a critical look at how we have been
                operating and why we are not more diverse with regards to gender
                and ethnicity. We should also look at the level of engagement in
                our current practitioners. Are they looking to transition out of
                the field? Are they fulfilled in their practice? How can
                Leadership and Management facilitate engagement? As we begin to
                examine our own clinical workforce we must take into account
                individual preferences for leadership behavior and acknowledge
                that this may require a shift in leadership attitude, policy,
                and implementation. (Ahn & Ettner, 2017) The accepted leadership
                behavior in most organizations outside Orthotics and Prosthetics
                is transformational leadership, a style of leadership where
                a leader works with subordinates to identify needed change,
                creating a vision to guide the change through inspiration, and
                executing the change in tandem with committed members of a
                group. (Ahn & Ettner, 2017) This model of leadership would work
                well in this profession that maintains a need for mentorship in
                the clinical practice.

                The field of Nursing specifically has examined the concept of
                circular communication as a next step toward engagement. There
                is an understanding that peer to peer communication as well as
                supervisor to subordinate communication should be circular - a
                two way dialoge with follow up. acknowledgement of peer to peer
                communication needs. Using tools such as the Maslach's Burnout
                Inventory and the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire may
                provide insight to employee burnout and the leadership style
                percieved to be most effective. (Zopiatis, Krambia-Kapardis, &
                Varnavas, 2012)
                <li>
                  Comparatively, the field of nursing is looking at these issues
                  and has done some research to work through these issues. How
                  can we provide guidance to the new generations without
                  alienating the incumbent workforce while providing a structure
                  to leadership?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Generational expectations of the workforce have been examined
                  in nursing. Nursing deals with similar leadership issues as
                  Orthotics and Prosthetics. Shift differentials, on call and
                  balancing patient needs with employee needs and expectations.
                  Nursing has more research into how to isolate and ameliorate
                  these issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compare literature from Nursing to that of O&P which has zero
                  peer reviewed literature on this subject.

                We must be careful of stereotypes and realize these
                “generational” preferences may have more to do with stage of
                life than their “generational cohort”
              </li>
              <li>
                The generation gap has always existed. We need to find a way to
                close the gap and tap into the strengths of each generation
                while lending our experience to the next generation for
                operational excellence.

              <li>
                Searching the library databases for “orthotics or prosthetics”
                AND “mentor*” turns up 39 results, very few are reflections or
                research about mentoring in the O&P workplace
              </li>
              <li>
                This demonstrates that very little research has been done in the
                O&P on its own professional culture. ● Other medical fields,
                such as nursing, regularly produce research reflecting on their
                own practices of mentoring, examinations of workplace culture
                and communication, and gender dynamics.

                  Because of this lack of research, I will use the nursing field
                  as a parallel. They have done research and have a gender
                  imbalance The generation gap has always existed. We need to
                  find a way to close the gap and tap into the strengths of each
                  generation while lending our experience to the next generation
                  for operational excellence. We must be careful not to

                  There is no feedback loop in peer to peer interactions
                  relating to leadership in many healthcare situations (O&P). We
                  are responsible to have circular feedback with our patients
                  however, with employees and leaders/management, the same
                  accountability is not upheld. There is no closure to
                  suggestions or issues that are taken up the chain of command.
                  This lack of accountability shows a lack of respect and
                  concern for the employee issues and affects all generations in
                  the workplace.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Without communication, the employee feels a lack of respect
                  and importance within their organizational role. If this is
                  repeated over time, at least in my case, there comes a point
                  of disengagement. When an employee disengages, they are not as
                  committed to the patients, their creativity is dampened and
                  therefore creative solutions for orthotic and prosthetic
                  problems are reduced. The patient in the end, pays for this.
