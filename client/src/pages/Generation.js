            <p>
              Currently there are five generations in the workforce. This
              represents the largest distribution of experience in history. I
              will focus here on the Boomers, Gen X and Gen Y. Though these
              three groups make up the largest part of the working population,
              we shouldn’t forget that the Traditional’s have experience to
              teach us and Gen Z will bring their own values to the workplace as
              they increase in numbers. Keep your eyes on them!
            </p>
            <p>
              One thing is clear, when studying generations, there are not
              always precise dates for determining the beginning and the end of
              a generational cohort. “A generation traditionally is interpreted
              as a span of about 20 years, although shorter periods can produce
              vast differences in culture. Away from work and in family
              situations, people of different generations relate to each other
              according to their roles as grandparents, parents, and children.
              Each role has different behaviors and expectations.” (Weingarten,
              2009)
            </p>
            <p>
              There is literature that argues for a description of each
              generation by an age range rather than a series of birth dates.
              Though this method of description may better address the lifetime
              needs and maturity of a cohort, that description may shift and
              cause confusion when comparing data. (Robinson & Jackson, 2001)
            </p>
            <p>
              For the purpose of this study, I will discuss cohorts as a date
              range, knowing full well that as these generations mature and
              encounter new life events, their attitudes will invariably shift.
              A cohort or a range of dates, is a soft indicator of a person
              belonging to a specific age group or generation. Dates chosen for
              these descriptors provide information about historical events that
              impact those born around this same time and raised around the same
              place.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              These commonly experienced events are what bind the generation
              together and provide a point of reference for these individuals as
              they are describing and interacting with the world around them.
              Keep in mind that these are not hard divisions and a person can
              relate to two cohorts at the same time depending on influences
              during their development. We MUST keep in mind that individual
              experiences are as much, possibly even more responsible, for the
              individual perspectives and attitudes of each person. We can
              establish a baseline understanding of each cohort but as leaders
              in organizations, we are responsible not to generalize to each
              individual but to use cohort information as a clue, further
              gathering individual information in order to best address the
              person. Also, keep in mind that as humans develop and mature,
              goals and ideals change. For example, something like a retirement
              plan may not be important to a person in their teens or early
              twenties but as they mature, future stability may become
              increasingly important.
            </p>
            <p>
              We see literature that indicates Generation Y and Z are less
              concerned with long term stability or health care plans than the
              Boomers or Generation X but as they begin to have families and
              look toward retirement, this may become increasingly important to
              them. While each generation has experienced certain historical and
              social events that have shaped their upbringing and had an impact
              on their expectations of their world, these expectations are
              carried into the workforce. Expectations have relevance in the
              long-term recruiting, and retention abilities of organizations.
              These are the expectations we need to learn about in order for O&P
              to be profitable, reduce recruiting costs and maximize human
              capital.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is interesting to note that these generational differences
              translate across countries and are not an issue solely pertaining
              to citizens within the United States however what may be termed as
              a “Baby Boomer” in the United States may have a completely
              different meaning and birth range in Japan. As our workplaces
              become more diverse we must be careful not to overgeneralize our
              expectations of our peers and their perspectives.

              This raises the point that we need to understand why Caucasians
              represent 82% of the O&P field while the US Census reports
              Caucasians at 67% of the general population.

              Why isn't the O&P field a better representation of the general

            </h3>
            <p>
              Though each generation claims common influence through events they
              experience, there are similarities that can and do cross the
              generational timeline and can be capitalized upon to pull workers
              together in the workplace. Though some feel it is important
              acknowledge our differences, I believe it is equally important to
              focus on our similarities. By changing our focus to the common
              things that are important for each generation, an organization can
              better adopt procedures to be more inclusive and tap into our
              understanding of the generation for the growth of the
              organization.

              <h4>Baby Boomers</h4>
            </p>
            <p>
              Most sources agree that this generation was born in 1946 to 1964,
              post WWII. This generation lived through the Cold War and the
              Vietnam War. The significant milestones seen during their
              formative years was the assassination of President John F.
              Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.,
              and the Civil Rights and Women’s Rights movements. (Weingarten, R.
              M. 2009)

            <p>
              {' '}
              “Workaholic” is a term used to describing this generation of
              workers as they believe in paying your dues and earning respect
              and promotions through this tireless ethic. Their work defines
              their personal fulfillment and self-worth. Boomers may have
              difficulty adapting to new technology. As this group is reaching
              retirement years, health concerns are increasing and we see a
              shift from more manual work to more supervisory roles. It is in
              this shift that we see more conflict in their abilities and
              technology. This generation may be less receptive to the “fast
              tracking” of the younger generations as they have not ”paid their
              dues”. (Weingarten, R. M. 2009)

                Tips for Leadership: This generation needs promises to be kept.
                They provide personal expertise that cannot be learned from a
                book. They can be counted on for their optimism, team
                orientation, work for personal fulfillment. (Weingarten, R. M.
                2009) Boomers value simplicity, being in control. They are risk
                takers and aggressive in their pursuits. (Mcintosh-Elkins,
                Mcritchie, & Scoones,2007)

            <h4>Generation X</h4>
            <p>
              These individuals were born 1965 to 1976 and are a relatively
              smaller demographic cohort sandwiched between the larger
              demographic cohorts of Baby Boomers and Generation Y. Gen X is
              sometimes referred as the “latchkey generation” and saw an
              increasing number of two income households. This generation is
              composed of individuals who know job stability is not guaranteed
              and are fiercely independent. They were witness to the
              introduction of the home computer and the internet. These adults
              are characterized as cynical, disaffected skeptics and radically
              individualistic. For this generation, respect must be earned by
              demonstration of expertise and a supportive attitude. “Generation
              X individuals seem to value greater autonomy and freedom with
              regard to how they work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gen Xers, however, show a tendency to prefer safer paths of action
              than their younger counterparts. With regard to the use and
              implementation of technology, Gen Xers are technologically adept
              and tend to use technology to personalize and humanize everything.
              (Reisenwitz & Iyer, 2009) They have a high preference for web
              applications and email-based communication. (Mhatre, K. H., &
              Conger, J. A. 2011) From everything we know about them, X’s are
              savvy, skeptical and self-reliant; they’re not into preening or
              pampering, and they just might not give much of a hoot what others
              think of them or if others think of them at all.” (Pew Research)
              Generation X-ers show a greater need for power than their younger
              cohort who tend to have a higher need for affiliation and
              achievement.

                Tips for Leadership: Working with individuals associated with
                the Generation X cohort, it may be helpful for leaders to
                recognize these individuals can be skeptical, independent, and
                informal. (Weingarten, R. M. 2009) They are tired of hearing,
                "it is tradition and we've always done it that way. These
                individuals are pragmatic and view life in survival mode. They
                can be flexible, adaptable, and are not afraid of making
                decisions. They like variety. They are less interested in future
                planning than their parents and have a good yet cynical sense of
                humor. Gen X is composed of individuals that are self-reliant
                and entrepreneurial.” (Mcintosh Elkins, J., Mcritchie, K., &

              <h4>Generation Y</h4>
            </p>
            <p>
              This group is commonly referred to as "Millennials" and were born
              during the 1980’s to early 1990’s. Some authorities state that
              Generation Y workers were born as early as 1978 (Martin &
              Tulgan,2001), whereas others have established a birth year for
              this generation as late as 1982. (Howe and Strauss, 2000)
              Interestingly, both of these sources define the end date for
              Generation Y as 2000. Other sources, such as The Center for
              Generational Kinetics, have rational for classifying the dates for
              Gen Y as 1977 to 1995. They note, "…birth range is slightly
              different from some other sources that believe the ending cutoff
              for Millennials is 2000. We strongly believe that the 2000 birth
              year is incorrect. The reason: the most important,
              generation-defining moment for Millennials (particularly in the
              U.S.), was September 11, 2001. It’s extremely difficult, if not
              impossible, to be born between 1996 and 2000 and have a strong,
              emotional connection to 9/11. Your brain is simply too young to
              put the event in a cultural, geographic, or other context. From
              our research-based vantage point, if you were born in the U.S. and
              9/11 has always been history to you—something you literally cannot
              remember—then you are not a Millennial but a member of Generation
              Z." (“The Center for Generational Kinetics”, 2017)
            </p>

            <p>
              Generation Y has grown up in a world where massive amounts of
              information and entertainment are readily available as cell
              phones, internet and video games are in every household. They
              value a work-personal life balance and they are willing to leave
              one job for another if it is beneficial for them. This generation
              is the hardest to recruit and retain (Weingarten, 2009) and has
              less loyalty to an organization than previous generations. They
              show a higher independence than their parents. They feel they must
              switch positions if needed in order to fulfill their aspirations
              for career growth. With a strong desire to achieve work-life
              balance they feel a need for altruistic activities. They prefer to
              work for an employer that garners their respect and will foster
              learning. These are important points to keep in mind as we recruit
              and try to retain these talented individuals. Communication on
              their terms is important and will likely require a shift in how we
              have always done things.

                Tips for Leadership: We must remember not to stereotype any
                Generation, instead to assess the individual at face value.
                Generation Y individuals seem to be self-confident and like
                Generation X they are self-reliant, independent and goal
                oriented. They tend to be more relaxed than previous generations
                and are able to take uncertainty in stride. They are team
                oriented like the Boomers. They want their jobs to be meaningful
                and have an impact, they want to achieve a work life balance.
                They do not expect their jobs to be their jobs for the rest of
                their life so they look forward to being excited about what they
                are doing now. (Mcintosh-Elkins, Mcintosh, Mcritchie, & Scoones,
                2007) Unlike previous Generations, specifically Generation X,
                these workers will easily shift from one employer to the next if
                they are not fulfilled. They are comfortable with collaborative
                tools such as cell phones, laptops, multimedia, instant
                messaging and may need businesses to acknowledge that in the
                workplace as well as in communication with their patients.
