                We should understand the needs and motivations of O&P
                professionals will change over time and understand that
                communication differences are present within genders and
                different generations. What works for a male may not work for a
                female. What works for a Baby Boomer will not always work for
                Generation Y. Each person regardless of gender and generation
                possesses their own strengths and individual weaknesses. Now
                with a workforce of "Millennial" adults quickly out numbering
                “Generation X", we may need to do business differently due to a
                generation gap or perceived generational differences. What if we
                maximized the strengths of our co-workers the same as we
                maximize the muscle group that is not impacted by a disease
                process? How will those strengths change over time as a
                clinician becomes more seasoned in their practice? Just as we
                encourage our patients to participate in physical therapy for
                strengthening or avoidance of contracture shouldn’t we consider
                the long-term goals of our practitioners and provide ”therapy”
                in the form of leadership training or at the very least
                mentoring?

              <h3>The Existing Research</h3>
              <p>
                As of 2017, the O&P community is composed of approximately 6,000
                professionals. Of those 6,000 practitioners, females make up
                just 27%. The male to female ratio has historically favored
                males however; the patient gender distribution is relatively
                evenly distributed. That said, why is the field so unbalanced?

              <p>
                This was the first question that began my search through the
                literature. I utilized Google Scholar as well as the University
                of Texas Libraries. My goal was to find out what the O&P
                community has as recorded reasons for this imbalance. I wanted
                to find articles on leadership, multigenerational values and
                suggestions of how leadership can address the issues of this
                particular time in history. I was sure I'd find data generated
                by the O&P community now that research is a requirement to earn
                a Master's Degree in Orthotics and Prosthetics and in order to
                enter the field.
                <p>
                  The terms used for my literature search centered around
                  “leadership”, “mentor”, “organizational culture” and
                  “organizational behavior” in “nursing” and “physical therapy”.
                  Hundreds of potential articles specifically relating to PT and
                  Nursing were returned. A similar search with “orthotics”,
                  “prosthetics”, or “O&P” resulted in less than ten specifically
                  addressing organizational behavior and culture in O&P and very
                  few reflections or research about mentoring in the O&P
                  workplace.

                      “These results demonstrate that very little research has
                      been done in the O&P on its own professional culture.
                      Other industries as well as allied medical fields, such as
                      nursing, regularly produce research reflecting on their
                      own practices of mentoring, examinations of workplace
                      culture and communication, and gender dynamics.”

                  Today, current managerial leadership in Orthotics and
                  Prosthetics is taught by “do as I say and sometimes do what I
                  do”. As I have learned, this method of mentoring may not be
                  appropriate for those newly entering the field. I then began
                  to wonder as I reflect on my personal experience in the field…
                  is this method of mentoring ever appropriate? Due to recent
                  change in the American health care system, it would be
                  advisable to consider the available research in health care
                  organizations and even in business and assess if a change in
                  O&P leadership practices is indicated. If we are to maintain
                  professionalism, improve our patient care practices, and
                  maintain marketability, we are obligated to move outside the
                  NUPOC definition of "research" and expand our sights to
                  include how individuals in our organizations behave.

                  Organizational culture sets an environment that encourages
                  employee citizenship. This in turn, often results in the
                  employee going “above and beyond” their specific duties to
                  better the organization. It has been shown that these
                  immeasurable behaviors have a direct impact on the viability
                  of a business. It is the culture, behavior and ultimately the
                  citizenship that we seem to admire in companies like Southwest
                  Airlines and Apple when the economy is depressed.

                <h4>Let's Look at the Generational Gap in Experience</h4>
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to be sustainable in the future, we must change how we
                look at research and ask ourselves how we can best serve our
                public and recognize changing trends in communication and
                expectations of the workplace. We must also consider that future
                generations may and likely DO have different perspectives around
                health care. These shifts have been documented extensively by
                other professions and show that the millennial generation looks
                at problems through a different lens than we have in the past.
                O&P should embrace a shift toward examining not only our
                biomechanical applications but also to look at how we
                communicate with those that are new to the workforce.

                Above are two tables as printed in the "Practice Analysis of
                Certified Practitioners in the Disciplines of Orthotics and
                Prosthetics" 2015 review (Whiteside, S. et.al., 2015). These
                tables show the age distribution of practitioners and the ethnic
                make-up of the field. As indicated by the tables above, the
                workforce is evenly distributed between the ages of 25-64 years.
                Because of the relatively even distribution of the current O&P
                workforce across age groups, we are provided an environment to
                share our perspectives relating to generational differences and
                begin to explore why our gender and ethnic distribution are not
                as equally distributed. With this information, we have an
                opportunity for a shift toward transformational leadership and
                an increased awareness of our gender, ethnic, and generational
                diversity. Because we do have a nice distribution of generations
                in the field, now would be an excellent opportunity to look at
                generational perspectives as other allied health professionals
                have done.
