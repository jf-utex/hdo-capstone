              Methods: Methods [based on these assumptions, here’s what we do] I
              have done a literature review as outlined by (Webster and Watson
              2017) in order to pull concepts of Leadership, multigenerational
              values and suggestions of how leadership can address the issues of
              this particular time in history within the o&p organization by
              looking at the field of nursing. The field of nursing also is
              struggling with these concepts but have gone further to
              investigate and implement solutions.

              Diversity within Orthotics and Prosthetics (O&amp;P) “Market
              competition and demographic changes in the labor force are two of
              the forces challenging organizations to develop more effective
              leadership training, and implementation programs.” (Ahn &amp;
              Ettner, 2017) An issue that faces the O&P profession is that there
              is no current leadership training in our curriculum or in
              practice. We, as a profession, are not looking at our culture
              through a critical lens to isolate strengths and weaknesses. This
              shortcoming may extend from the cornerstone of our industry’s
              education stated purpose of research. “Research strives to improve
              quantification and objective scientific evidence that informs
              P&amp;O clinical decision-making; and to develop new concepts and
              devices that will improve the quality, cost-effectiveness, and
              delivery of P&amp;O fittings. “(NUPOC, 2017) This perspective
              ignores the need for internal examination of policies, practice,
              culture and leadership. Without examining who we are and why we do
              what we do, we are missing the opportunity to improve our
              interpersonal relationships between each other and our patients.
              While O&amp;P has been excellent at examining the biomechanical
              and anatomical principles, we are ignoring the fact that other
              allied health care organizations are looking at ways to improve
              their mentorship, leadership and ways to grow their field. The
              current leadership literature produced by O&amp;P is scant
              considering the available resources that are developed in nursing,
              physical therapy and other allied health care divisions. To be
              sustainable in the future, we must change how we look at research
              and ask ourselves how we can best serve our public by recognizing
              changing trends in communication and perspectives toward health
              care. These shifts have been documented extensively and show that
              the millennial generation looks at problems through a different
              lens than we have in the past. To be sustainable as a profession,
              O&amp;P should embrace a shift toward examining not only our
              biomechanical applications but also to look at how we communicate
              with those that are new to the workforce. To be recognized as a
              profession, something the organization has struggled with, we
              should develop a culture that includes transformational
              leadership. Most of the literature to date reflects concern for
              managing patient centered needs and concerns, patient compliance
              and O&amp;P technology. There is little to no peer reviewed
              research into transformational leadership within O&amp;P. This may
              be an increasing concern as we compete for pay sources, attempt to
              maintain a level of professionalism equal to that of other allied
              health care groups and may be impacting our recruitment and
              retention. A literature search in Google Scholar may return
              1,000’s of results when searching “leadership in physical therapy”
              however, only 1-2 relevant articles pertaining specifically to
              O&amp;P. Current managerial leadership is taught by “do as I say
              and sometimes do what I do”. This method of mentoring may not be
              appropriate for those newly entering the field and I believe it is
              our responsibility to explore that possibility to better serve
              ourselves and our public. Jeannie FlahertyStructure of
              Organizations22-Aug- 17 The dynamics of our organization has
              changed in recent decades. We are having more difficulty filling
              seats in our O&amp;P education programs as evidenced by the
              reduction of “wait lists” that were prevalent in the 1990’s. This
              shift may be due to an increase in schools but may equally be
              likely due to the increased educational requirements. Even more,
              this shift may be due to a lack of interest in the field. The
              “Practice Analysis of Certified Practitioners in the Disciplines
              of Orthotics and Prosthetics” is a report that is released every 5
              to 7 years but is not widely accessible. One must know of its
              existence to obtain the information within. It is noted in the
              most recent edition, produced in 2015, that most practitioners
              have been in the field for more than 11 years with a stark
              decrease in the number of clinicians serving 10 years or less. I’m
              not sure what this indicates but would lead me to wonder if there
              is a lack of interest in the field or if individuals leave the
              field. This is a question that could be answered with a look into
              our culture. As we move toward requiring a Master’s and PhD level
              of education our focus has shifted from encouraging new
              practitioners to join the field to maintaining and educating those
              that are already established. With the O&amp;P workforce of just
              over 6,000 practitioners in 2017, we continue to be a small
              division of medicine. Recruitment and retention should be a focus
              to sustain, even grow the field, as qualified O&P practitioners
              will be needed to care for our aging population. According to a
              survey that was administered in 2015 by the American Board for
              Certification in Orthotics, Prosthetics and Pedorthics, there
              continues to be a lack of diversity regarding gender and ethnicity
              within O&P in the United States. Of the respondents, only 27% are
              female and 84% of the field is White/Caucasian.

              However, the age distribution, as indicated by Figure 1, shows
              that the workforce is evenly distributed between the ages of 25-64
              years (Whiteside, S, et. al, 2015). Because the relatively even
              distribution of the current O&P workforce across age groups, we
              are provided an environment to share our perspectives relating to
              generational differences and begin to explore why our gender and
              ethnic distribution are not as equally distributed. With this
              information, we have an opportunity for a shift toward
              transformational leadership implementation and an increased
              awareness of our gender, ethnic, and generational diversity. To
              grow the field and encourage new applicants to our O&P schools,
              two things must happen, we must first understand what traits or
              behaviors seem to be associated with each generation in the
              workforce, and how they perceive effective leadership. By
              examining these expectations, we will be closer to easing the
              transition as one group leaves and the other replaces it as well
              as potentially identifying factors that may help with recruitment
              and retention. The labor force is affected by a number of people
              retiring each year with a direct impact on the economy’s capacity
              to produce goods and services (Ahn &amp; Ettner, 2017). We must be
              careful not to stereotype a particular generation instead, we must
              consider that an individual employee’s preferences may be related
              to maturity, life‐cycle and career stage. This will help us to
              avoid developing generationally specific management policies and
              practices (Macky, Gardner, &amp; Forsyth, 2008) Jeannie
              FlahertyStructure of Organizations22-Aug- 17 Second, we must take
              a critical look at how we have been operating and why we are not
              more diverse with regards to gender and ethnicity. As we begin to
              examine our own clinical workforce we must take into account
              individual preferences for leadership behavior and acknowledge
              that this may require a shift in leadership attitude, policy, and
              implementation. (Ahn &amp; Ettner, 2017) The accepted leadership
              behavior in most organizations outside Orthotics and Prosthetics
              is transformational leadership, a style of leadership where
              a leader works with subordinates to identify needed change,
              creating a vision to guide the change through inspiration, and
              executing the change in tandem with committed members of a group.
              (Ahn &amp; Ettner, 2017) This model of leadership would work well
              in this profession that maintains a need for mentorship in the
              clinical practice. As we move forward, to advance the profession
              and best care for our diverse patient population as well as to
              promote a more engaged workforce, I would suggest that the O&amp;P
              community focus resources to research specifically the leadership
              needs of the next generation, and the impact of gender and
              ethnicity has on our workplace and patient management.
